# LeetCode 392 - Easy - Is Subsequence

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or `false` otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false

要求判断一个字符串 `s` 是否为另一个字符串 `t` 的子序列。子序列是指可以通过删除原字符串中的某些字符（或不删除任何字符），而不改变其余字符的顺序得到的新字符串。
